npm run build

# Test production build locally (optional)
npm run preview
```

2. **Drag and Drop**:
   - Build locally: `npm run build`
   - Drag `app/dist` folder to Netlify dashboard
   - Custom domain and SSL included

#### Vercel
1. **GitHub Integration**:
   - Import project from GitHub
   - Framework: React (Vite)
   - Root directory: `app`
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Output directory: `dist`

#### GitHub Pages
1. **Actions Workflow** (create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`):
```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - run: cd app && npm install
      - run: cd app && npm run build
      - uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./app/dist
```

### Custom Domain Setup
1. Purchase domain from provider (Namecheap, GoDaddy, etc.)
2. Configure DNS settings:
   - For Netlify: Point to Netlify DNS servers
   - For Vercel: Add CNAME record pointing to Vercel
3. Enable SSL certificate (automatic with most platforms)
