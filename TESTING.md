# Testing Documentation

## Testing Strategy

The Pink Blueberry Salon implements a comprehensive testing strategy using **Vitest** and **React Testing Library** to ensure code quality and functionality.

## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests
- **Button Component**: Tests all variants, sizes, and interactions
- **CartContext**: Tests cart functionality including add, remove, update, and clear operations
- **Utility Functions**: Tests helper functions for price formatting, email validation, and calculations

### Integration Tests
- **App Component**: Tests overall application structure and rendering

## Test Structure

```

```

## Running Tests

### Development Commands
```bash
# Run tests in watch mode (development)
npm run test

# Run tests once (CI/production)
npm run test:run

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

### Test Files Overview

#### Component Tests (`Button.test.jsx`)
- Renders correctly with different props
- Applies correct CSS classes for variants
- Handles click events properly
- Supports disabled state
- Accepts custom styling

#### Context Tests (`CartContext.test.jsx`)
- Initializes empty cart state
- Adds items to cart with quantity tracking
- Updates item quantities
- Removes items from cart
- Calculates totals correctly
- Clears entire cart

#### Utility Tests (`helpers.test.js`)
- Price formatting with currency symbols
- Phone number formatting
- Email validation regex
- Booking reference generation
- Total calculation for cart items

#### Integration Tests (`App.test.jsx`)
- Application renders without errors
- Navigation elements are present
- Main content areas load correctly
- Brand styling is applied

## Testing Standards

### Coverage Goals
- **Target Coverage**: >50% (judging criteria requirement)
- **Current Coverage**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests
- **Focus Areas**: Critical business logic, user interactions, data management

### Test Quality
- **Descriptive Test Names**: Clear description of what's being tested
- **Assertion Quality**: Meaningful expectations that verify functionality
- **Edge Case Handling**: Tests for invalid inputs and error conditions
- **User-Centric Testing**: Tests focus on user interactions and experiences

## Continuous Integration

Tests are configured to run in CI/CD pipelines with:
- Automated test execution on code changes
- Coverage reporting for quality metrics
- Fast feedback loop for developers
- Integration with deployment workflows

## Mock Strategy

### External Dependencies
- React Router DOM: Wrapped in test providers
- Context Providers: Custom wrapper components for isolated testing
- API Calls: Mocked for predictable test results (future implementation)

### Test Data
- Standardized test fixtures for consistent testing
- Realistic data that matches production scenarios
- Edge case data for error handling validation

## Quality Assurance

### Test Maintenance
- Regular review of test coverage
- Update tests when features change
- Remove obsolete tests for refactored code
- Add tests for new functionality

### Performance Testing
- Fast test execution (<2 seconds for full suite)
- Optimized test setup and teardown
- Minimal test dependencies
- Efficient assertion strategies

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Testing Additions
- **End-to-End Tests**: Cypress or Playwright for user journey testing
- **Visual Regression Tests**: Screenshot comparison for UI consistency
- **Performance Tests**: Load testing for cart operations
- **Accessibility Tests**: Automated a11y testing integration

### Testing Tools Roadmap
- **Test Coverage Visualization**: Interactive coverage reports
- **Test Analytics**: Test performance and reliability metrics
- **Automated Test Generation**: AI-assisted test creation for new components
